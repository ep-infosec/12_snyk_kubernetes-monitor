Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Snyk Kubernetes monitor. This project is maintained by Snyk, and relies on the Snyk service to function. However, if you have a suggestion or idea for a feature, or want to send a pull request, the Contribution Agreement below will apply.

# Testing

In order to run the tests for the Snyk Kubernetes monitor you will need a suitable development environment installed.

Requirements and additional information on how to run the tests can be found in [the tests' readme](https://github.com/snyk/kubernetes-monitor/tree/staging/test).

# How to submit changes

If you have a suggested change then please open an issue to discuss first, unless the proposed change is trivial or easier to discuss around the code change.  

# How to report a bug

As the Snyk Kubernetes monitor only works in conjunction with the paid-for Snyk service, reporting issues via the [usual Snyk customer support channels](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) is prefered. If a public record of the issue is useful to reference please do open an issue on this repository but also open a support ticket to reference it.

# How to request an enhancement

Requests for new features are best handled via the standard [Snyk support channels](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) or talking with your customer support manager.
